Code and minimum working example for EMS Bonn 2022 paper (De Baar, Garcia-Marti, Van der Schrier)

Welcome to this github. You probably reached this from the link in our submitted EMS Bonn 2022 manuscript on crowd-sourced data?
Actually, we have moved the files to the more official and permanent location:

https://gitlab.com/KNMI-OSS/hi-res-interpolations/ems_bonn_2022_crowdsourced

We will include this link in the next update of our submitted manuscript.
